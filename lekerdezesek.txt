'Computer games to support arm rehabilitation after stroke',0,'The overall aim of this PhD project is to further develop this prototype to optimise its therapeutic potential and usability by considering design requirements from stakeholders (i.e. stroke survivors and carers, and health professionals such as occupational therapists and physiotherapists).','Stroke is one of the most common causes of disability across the world. Up to 80% of acute stroke patients experience loss of arm function, including loss of strength, coordination and manual dexterity, which can make daily activities such as self-care and food preparation difficult. In turn, these difficulties may affect autonomy, self-esteem, mood and quality of life. In a considerable proportion of stroke survivors, arm impairment persists after formal rehabilitation has ceased. The potential for recovery after stroke persists, but requires dedicated, intensive functional training. This can be difficult for stroke survivors to commit to, e.g. due to fatigue, shoulder pain, depression or lack of support. Recent years have seen an increase in evidence supporting the use of commercial games to improve arm function after stroke (Thomson et al., 2014). This approach has considerable potential to improve arm function by increasing engagement with activities at home, providing a low-cost adjunct to formal rehabilitation and utilising inexpensive off the shelf game technology that is easily available. However, most commercial games have not been designed for people with complex disabilities and would require considerable adaptation for use in the home. Additionally, there is now a significant body of music psychology research demonstrating the benefits of preferred music listening upon a range of factors related to health and wellbeing. Specifically, research has demonstrated the benefits of rhythmic auditory stimulation integrated with repetitive task practice on arm function in stroke survivors - i.e. the synchronisation of movement with an audible rhythm (van Wijck et al., 2012).
At GCU, we have developed a bespoke prototype music game, which integrates the principles of rhythmic auditory stimulation with repetitive practice, based on individuals’ preferred music. This game, which uses off-the-shelf technology, has been specifically designed for stroke survivors with a range of impairments (including arm motor, visual and cognitive impairments) (Averell & Knox, 2019).','Glasgow Caledonian University','Dr K Thomson','Dr K Thomson, Dr D Knox, Prof F van Wijck','https://www.gcu.ac.uk/hls/research/researchgroups/livingwithstroke/','Arts PhD Projects'

('Women in the Legal Profession: Comparative analysis between China and the United Kingdom',
'', 
'',
'Academic research in the developed West has paid much attention to women in the legal world – the judiciary and the legal profession. The scholarship is politically important in the West as it is about a matter of democracy. In recent years, scholarly research on the subject has increased elsewhere in the world, seeking to fill in the gaps in knowledge and international literature about women’s representation and the roles they play in the elite professions in law. China is one of the latecomers. As regards China, recent studies have investigated female legal professionals, focusing on feminisation and gender inequality for women lawyers (see, for example, Michelson, 2009), and female judges’ roles and positions in the justice system and judicial production (see Shen, 2017). However, much remains to be done to further explore women’s participation and performance in legal institutions and processes. This project aims to generate rich empirical data to address the gaps in existing literature, by examining female legal professionals in China and the United Kingdom (UK) – two jurisdictions with remarkably distinct legal histories and socio-political realities, between which gender is a shared concept.
The proposed study will be empirically based and seeks to gain primary and secondary data about women in the legal professions in China and the UK, to examine how gender socially and professionally impacts on women. It will be designed to place female lawyers in the center of the study, by listening to their own voices, about social and professional expectations of women (and men), their current status in their profession, their gendered concerns, and whether women bring anything unique to the legal system and practice. Furthermore, the study’s comparative approaches will explore how tradition and culture impact on women’s views about feminism, socio-cultural gender norms, gender equality and gender-related discrimination in the two systems.',

'Applied Economics: What works for firms and the gender pay gap?',
'',
'',
'A vast literature has studied the determinants of gender pay gaps (see for reviews Altonji and Blank, 1999; Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer, 2005; Blau and Kahn, 2017). Explanations for the labour market differences between men and women are typically grouped into three broad categories: productivity, preferences and discrimination, which are all interrelated (Altonji and Blank, 1999). However, with the diminishing of gender gaps in the majority of developed countries, the importance and focus on explanations from the first category, especially human capital-based ones, has lessened. Nonetheless, pay gaps persist and are pervasive. More recent work has looked to gender differences in preferences and psychological attributes, and how these impact on productivity, choices and beliefs (see for reviews Croson and Gneezy, 2009; Bertrand, 2011; Azmat and Petrongolo, 2014). The role of firms, in particular where men and women work, cuts across across these sets of explanations. Early work found that women in the US were more likely to work for lower wage firms than men, and vice versa regarding higher wage firms (Blau, 1977; Groshen, 1991; Bayard et al., 2003). More recent studies have found that low wage growth within an establishment for women plays a bigger role in the US gender pay gap than how women are (not) sorted into higher wage firms (Goldin et al., 2017; Barth et al., 2017). More widely and in several countries, studies have begun to document the importance of which firms men and women work for in accounting for the level and trends of the gender pay gap (e.g. US: Sorkin, 2017; Portugal: Card et al., 2016, Cardoso et al., 2016; Germany: Bruns, 2018; France: Coudin et al., 2018; Denmark: Gallen et al., 2017; UK: Jewell et al., 2018).
Even as it becomes clearer that firms have an important role to playing in closing the gender pay gap throughout the earnings distribution, there is a significant evidence gap in understanding what particular firm-based policies and management practices work for both the individual firm and gender equality. Filling this evidence gap will allow advice to be given on effective future policy making in this area.
This project will involve working with secure access sources of UK data. Due to the nature of the datasets and access requirements, distance learning is not possible. The PhD student would benefit from working as a team n this project with at least 2 established academics in the Department of Economics at the University of Reading, one of whom would be the PhD supervisor. They can expect to coauthor research outputs (publications) with these academics, which would contribute to some part to their PhD thesis. In addition, they would develop their own independent research agenda, advised by their supervision team and building on what they learn from collaboration with on the project. This would contribute to the remainder of their PhD thesis.
Ideally the PhD student would have experience of handling large datasets, statistical software such as SAS, SPSS, Stata or R, and have studied MSc level topics in microeconometrics and labour economics.',

'Exploring the interaction of genes and environment in the development of Alzheimer’s disease',
'',
'In this landmark study, Professor Jonathan Schott and colleagues at UCL are tapping into an incredible national resource, the MRC National Survey of Health and Development, which has followed 5,362 individuals born in mainland Britain in one week in 1946. The team will combine information from genetic analysis of DNA samples with information from neuro-imaging and cognitive testing to explore the interaction of genes and environment in the development of Alzheimer’s and other brain diseases.',
'Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia.
Increasing age is the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s, with the risk of developing the disease doubling every five years beyond the age of 65 years.
Genetic factors also play an important role in Alzheimer’s risk, conferring as much as 60 to 70 per cent of the risk of developing the disease in old-age. Whilst the vast majority of cases are not directly inherited, there are around 20 genes that are known to be associated with the disease. A number of ‘life course’ risks (such as hypertension and diabetes) have also been identified. How and why these life course and genetic risks combine to lead to the initiation and evolution of Alzheimer’s is not yet known.
The pathological changes underpinning Alzheimer’s are thought to develop at least a decade prior to the onset of symptoms, giving a window of opportunity to not only track the evolution of the disease but also potentially to intervene to prevent the onset of cognitive symptoms. The Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) is a unique study that has followed 5,362 individuals since their birth in England, Scotland and Wales during one week in 1946.
These individuals have been tracked in 24 waves of data collection, meaning that an unprecedented amount of information is known about their medical history and lifestyle. Now aged 73 years, a small fraction of the participants have overt dementia whilst estimates suggest that around a third may be in the pre-clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease.
Insight 46 is a neuroscience sub-study of NSHD. Led by Professor Jonathan Schott and colleagues at the Institute of Neurology, Insight 46 aims to identify lifetime factors that influence brain health and cognitive ageing, with particular focus on Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease. This will provide an evidence base for the design of disease-modifying trials.
In Insight 46, 500 NSHD members are being invited to participate in a neuroimaging study that involves two research visits, two years apart. On each visit, the volunteers are undergoing detailed brain scanning to assess brain shrinkage, vascular damage, brain connections, and the presence of Alzheimer-related proteins. They are undergoing detailed memory testing at the same time. This will provide invaluable information about the brain changes accompanying pre-symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease.
Brain Research UK provided funds to support genetic analysis of DNA samples from the 500 volunteers taking part in Insight 46, plus a wider sample of NSHD volunteers, 2,380 individuals in total. These genetic analyses will be done in collaboration with Dr Jose Bras and his team, also based at the Institute of Neurology.
The aim of these genetic analyses is to determine the presence of genetic risk factors associated with the early signs of Alzheimer’s (including amyloid deposition, brain shrinkage and subtle memory problems) and to combine this information with all that is known about the health and lifestyle of each individual to build up “risk profiles” for the development of Alzheimer’s in particular and dementia more generally.
Current treatments for Alzheimer’s disease do not represent a cure. At best, they alleviate some of the symptoms of this cruel disease.
This work by Professor Schott and colleagues will build on existing knowledge of the life-course and genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s, helping us to disentangle the different factors. The hope is that the genetic analyses will help us to predict who is at risk of developing the disease and who would benefit from new treatments as they become available. The ultimate aim is to identify at-risk individuals and offer them treatments to delay – or even prevent – disease onset.
With an ageing population, the burden of Alzheimer’s and dementia is increasing on a global level. It has been estimated that a five-year delay in symptom onset would halve prevalence, costs and burden of Alzheimer’s.',

'Regeneration and recovery following spinal cord injury',
'',
'Professor Simone Di Giovanni was awarded a Brain Research UK project grant in September 2018 for research that sets out to understand the complex mechanisms underlying regeneration of nerve fibres.
Building on an existing body of research from two world-leading labs, this study will test different combinations of rehabilitation and treatment in rodents following spinal cord injury, assessing regeneration and recovery, and analysing genetic changes in the regenerating neurons. Following rigorous assessment as part of our competitive project grant round, this project was selected for funding because the members of our Scientific Advisory Panel felt that it would make an important contribution to knowledge in an important area, with high unmet need. The panel agreed that the project would give important insight to the process of axon plasticity and regeneration, and had every confidence in the team's ability to deliver against the ambitious objectives.',
'It is estimated that there are around 40,000 people living with a spinal cord injury in the UK, with around 1,000 new injuries occurring each year.
Damage to the spinal cord is irreparable. Severe spinal cord injury leads to serious, permanent impairment. Depending on the site of the injury, it may affect not only movement and sensation, but potentially also bowel and bladder function, breathing, heart rate and blood pressure. Current rehabilitation has some benefit after moderate spinal cord injury, but fails to improve recovery after more severe injuries.  
In contrast to the irreparable nature of damage to the spinal cord (which, together with the brain, forms the central nervous system, CNS), nerves in the peripheral nervous system do have the capacity to grow back.  
The peripheral nervous system is the network of nerves that links the CNS to the rest of the body. People with nerve damage in their peripheral nervous system can recover some lost function; about 30 per cent of the nerves grow back and there is often recovery of movement and function.
A key aim is to understand why nerve fibres (axons) in the peripheral nervous system regenerate when those in the CNS do not. Prof Di Giovanni’s work is focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying axonal regeneration, and how these mechanisms can be exploited in the context of the spinal cord.
In this project, he is continuing a collaboration with Professor Gregoire Courtine at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, a world-leader in neurorehabilitation.
The team will first use electrical stimulation in combination with rehabilitation in rodents with spinal cord injury.
They will then use these techniques in combination with a drug that has been previously shown to promote axonal regeneration.
Functional recovery and axonal regeneration will be assessed at both stages, and the team will also analyse changes in gene expression in the relevant neurons. This will give a better understanding of the molecular events underpinning recovery and regeneration and will inform the design of new therapies.
“Both Giovanni and Courtine are at the forefront of the field of molecular mechanisms of axonal regeneration and mechanistic approaches to rehabilitation of the nervous system, respectively. This collaboration is really exciting, given the outstanding experience and productivity of the investigators.” External reviewer.   There is currently no treatment that can repair a spinal cord injury. Those affected live in hope of a breakthrough that may help them regain lost function.
This exciting project builds on an existing collaboration between two world-leading teams who will apply their combined expertise and skills to advance our understanding of the mechanisms involved in nerve regeneration. This will underpin efforts to develop interventions that can promote repair of the spinal cord and enable people with spinal cord injuries to recover function.
“This is an exciting and innovative project that is sure to generate findings highly relevant to spinal cord repair in humans.” External reviewer.',

  'Biogas upgrading by means of cyclic adsorption processes',
  '',
  'Global warming is one of the most worldwide current challenges facing humanity, a direct consequence of the increasing CO2 emissions generated from the combustion of fossil fuels. To confront the current energy production footprint, research on transformative and more efficient technologies to produce energy from renewables, and cleaner energy from fossil fuels (Carbon Capture Utilisation & Storage, CCUS) is unquestionably needed. Biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion of organic waste is a clean and renewable source of energy, considered as one of the most environmentally friendly technologies for replacing fossil fuels.',
  'Accordingly, this project will study alternative biogas upgrading strategies based on the separation by adsorption, targeting at increasing the efficiency of the overall separation process, and hence reduce the energy required per m3 of biogas upgraded, as well as the purity and recovery of the biomethane produced.

  'Investigation of enhanced oil recovery processes in complex fractured reservoirs',
  '',
  'Oil recovery from fractured reservoirs is a complex process due to the presence of high-permeability fracture networks. Many processes that have been used successfully in sandstone reservoirs may not be economically feasible in fractured reservoirs. In most of the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes, immiscible displacement of oil phase is involved. Immiscible displacement in porous media during enhanced oil recovery processes requires in-depth understanding of rock and fluids interactions. Furthermore, liquid chemicals/foam can be used to unlock oil from reservoirs where high-contrast of permeability is a challenge for gas injection. In this project, the oil recovery process from fractured reservoirs where the flow channels are complex will be investigated. It is aimed to develop a representative physical model for immiscible displacement process experiments in the laboratory and visualise the interaction of displacing and displaced fluids. Then different injection scenarios will be studied, and optimisation of the injection schemes to achieve high energy efficiencies will be conducted.',
